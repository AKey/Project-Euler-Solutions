# Contributing
To contribute you need to fork this repository and submit a pull request for the changes that you're proposing.

When adding a solution for a problem you must also write a test method for the problem. This test does not aim to check if your answer is correct, it will help you to check if your code works as expected and nothing else is broken in project.
